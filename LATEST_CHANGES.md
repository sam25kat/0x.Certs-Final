## üîê Admin Management System

### PostgreSQL Migration
**Problem:** "Manage Admins" (formerly "Manage Organizer Emails") dialog showed "No admin emails found" even though emails existed in PostgreSQL.

**Root Cause:** All three organizer email endpoints were still using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL.

**Solution:**
- Migrated `GET /organizer/emails` to PostgreSQL
- Migrated `POST /organizer/add-email` to PostgreSQL
- Migrated `POST /organizer/remove-email` to PostgreSQL
- Changed table name from `organizer_emails` to `organizers`

### Session Management Fix
**Problem:** Session token not being stored in `organizer_sessions` table after OTP verification.

**Solution:**
- Sessions now properly created with 7-day expiration after OTP verification
- Added session entry creation in `organizer_sessions` table
- Session verification now works correctly across all organizer endpoints

### Database Schema Migration
**Changes:**
- Added `is_root` BOOLEAN column to `organizers` table
- Added `is_active` BOOLEAN column to `organizers` table
- Updated `ensure_root_organizers()` to set `is_root = TRUE` for root admins
- Migration runs automatically on server startup

### Email Reactivation Feature
**Problem:** Deleted emails (is_active = FALSE) couldn't be re-added, showing "Email already exists" error.

**Solution:**
- Add email function now checks if email exists but is inactive
- Reactivates inactive emails instead of throwing error
- Prevents duplicate email issues from soft-delete pattern

### Loading Animations
**Added:**
- **Add Email Button**: Shows spinner and "Adding..." text while processing
- **Delete Icon**: Shows spinning loader icon while removing email
- Input field disabled during add operation
- Buttons disabled during operations to prevent double-clicks

### UI Rebranding
**Changed throughout frontend:**
- "Manage Organizers" ‚Üí "Manage Admins"
- "organizers" ‚Üí "admins" in all user-facing text
- Dialog titles, descriptions updated
- Placeholder text: "new.organizer@example.com" ‚Üí "new.admin@example.com"
- "Current Organizers" ‚Üí "Current Admins"
- "Loading emails..." ‚Üí "Loading admins..."

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added 401 error handling with proper session expiry messages
- Automatically clears session and prompts login when unauthorized
- Clear error messages displayed to users

## üìß Certificate Generation Improvements

### Immediate Email Sending
**What Changed:**
```
BEFORE: Generate all certs ‚Üí Send all emails
AFTER:  Generate cert 1 ‚Üí Send email 1 ‚Üí Generate cert 2 ‚Üí Send email 2...
```

**Benefits:**
- Emails sent immediately after each certificate generation
- Progress bar updates after each email instead of bulk sending at end
- Real-time email status visibility in progress dialog
- Better SMTP stability with individual connections per email

### Email Status Tracking
- Added email success/failure counts to completion summary
- Toast notifications show email delivery statistics
- Clear indication of failed emails with count

**Example Toast:**
```
Certificate Generation Completed!
‚úÖ Certificates: 10/10
üìß Emails sent: 8/10
‚ö†Ô∏è 2 email(s) failed
```

## üìä Event Management Enhancements

### Auto-Refresh After Certificate Generation
**Problem:** Event cards didn't refresh after certificate generation, requiring manual page refresh.

**Solution:**
- Added `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['events'] })`
- Added `refetchEvents()` call after completion
- Shows updated certificate counts immediately
- Works for both success and failure (to show partial progress)

### View Participants Loading Animation
- Added loading animation to "View Participants" button
- Spinner icon displays while fetching participant data
- Button disabled during load to prevent multiple clicks

### Select Next 25 Filters
**Added status-based filtering for participant selection:**
- **All Participants**: Selects next 25 regardless of status
- **POA Minted**: Only participants with `poa_status === 'minted'`
- **POA Unminted**: Only participants without POA minted
- **POA Transferred**: Only participants with `poa_status === 'transferred'`

**Implementation:**
- Accurate filtering using actual database `poa_status` field values
- Removed confusing/redundant filter options based on user feedback
- Fixed logic to use exact status matches

### Delete Event Loading Animation
- Added loading animation to event deletion confirmation
- "Deleting..." text with spinner during deletion
- Button disabled to prevent accidental double-clicks

### Certificate Status Button Removed
- Removed unused "Certificate Status" button from event cards
- Cleaned up UI clutter

## üö® Error Messaging & User Feedback

### IPFS Error Messages
**Problem:** Progress dialog showing "Bulk mint preparation failed:" with no error message after colon.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced error parsing for Pinata/IPFS failures
- Clear "IPFS Account Error" messages displayed in bulk mint operations
- Extracts nested JSON errors from HTTPException responses
- Backend re-raises HTTPException to preserve error details

**Example Error Display:**
```
Preparing bulk mint
IPFS Account Error: Account blocked due to plan usage limit
```

### Progress Dialog Stability
**Problem:** Progress tracking dialogs randomly closing during operations.

**Solution:**
- Dialog cannot be closed while operations are in progress
- Only allows closing when all steps completed or errored
- Checks for loading steps before allowing `onOpenChange`

## üé® UI/UX Polish

### Landing Page Smoke Effect
**Reduced cursor smoke effect intensity for subtler appearance:**
- Increased density dissipation: `3.5` ‚Üí `4.5` (smoke fades faster)
- Reduced splat radius: `0.2` ‚Üí `0.16` (smaller particles)
- Reduced saturation: `30-60%` ‚Üí `25-50%` (less saturated colors)
- Reduced brightness: `15-40%` ‚Üí `10-28%` (dimmer smoke)

### Consistent Loading States
- Loader2 spinning icons throughout application
- Disabled states during operations
- Clear loading feedback for users
